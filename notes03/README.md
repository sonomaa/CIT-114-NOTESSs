# Notes 3: Cloud Global Infrastructure

### What is an Operating System? 
- An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language. Without an operating system, a computer is useless. 
### What is an OS' job? 
- Other than managing the computer's hardware and software... The OS coordinates access to the computer's CPU, memory, and storage to ensure the program gets what it needs. 
### Types of OS
- Windows, Macintosh, Linux. All use GUI (Graphic User Interface) which uses a mouse and icons. 
## AWS Compute Services 
### Virtual Machines 
- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. This allows you to build Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) applications for instance-based virtual machines. 
### Serverless 
- AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consumeâ€”there is no charge when your code is not running.
### Containers 
- AWS offers many different container services such as Amazon Elastic Container Service, Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, AWS Fargate, and Amazon Elastic Container Registry. These services are instance-based and enable you to run multiple workloads on a single OS. Containers spin up more quickly than virtual machines, thus offering responsiveness.
### Platform as a Service
- PaaS allows a company to focus on coding and making apps rather than managing infrastructure. AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides PaaS. It facilitates the quick deployment of applications that you create by providing all the application services that you need.
### Important Services and what the do: 
- EC2 Provides resizable virtual machines. 
- AWS Lambda is a serverless compute solution. You pay only for the compute time that you use. 
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides a simple way to run and manage web applications.
### Instances 
- virtualized servers, allowing you to change their capabilities with a button. At AWS, these virtual server instances come in different families and sizes, and they offer a wide variety of capabilities. 
- A method of OS virtualization that allow you to run an application and its dependencies in resource-isolated processes. AWS Fargate. 
### Functions 
- abstract the execution environment from the code you want to execute. AWS Lambda.
