# Notes 3: Cloud Global Infrastructure

### What is an Operating System? 
- An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language. Without an operating system, a computer is useless. 
### What is an OS' job? 
- Other than managing the computer's hardware and software... The OS coordinates access to the computer's CPU, memory, and storage to ensure the program gets what it needs. 
### Types of OS
- Windows, Macintosh, Linux. All use GUI (Graphic User Interface) which uses a mouse and icons. 
## AWS Compute Services 
### Virtual Machines 
- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. This allows you to build Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) applications for instance-based virtual machines. 
### Serverless 
- AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consumeâ€”there is no charge when your code is not running.
### Containers
