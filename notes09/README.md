# Notes 9: Cloud Architecture

### 5 Pillars of AWS Well ARchitected Framework 

#### Operational Excellence 
- the ability to support development and run workloads effectively, gain insight into their operation, and continuously improve supporting processes and procedures to delivery business value. 
#### Security
-  ability to protect data, systems, and assets to take advantage of cloud technologies to improve your security. 
#### Reliability
- Reliability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when itâ€™s expected to.
- Should a failure happen, this will affect the mean time between failures (MTBF) is equal to the total time in service divided by the number of failures.
- Another metric is the mean time to failure (MTTF) which is the length of time a system is available until it fails.
- The mean time to repair (MTTR) is the amount of time taken to repair a system. 
#### Performance Efficiency
-  the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.
#### Cost Optimization
- the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. 


### Availability 
- availability is used to describe the period of time when a service is available, as well as the time required by a system to respond to a request made by a user. 
- High availability (HA) is a quality of a system or component that assures a high level of operational performance for a given period of time.
- Service Level Agreements (SLA) which define the level of service you can expect from the provider.

### AWS Trusted Advisor
- online tool that provides you real time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices. Trusted Advisor checks help optimize your AWS infrastructure, increase security and performance, reduce your overall costs, and monitor service limits. 

### Facts I learned :  I learned about the AWS Five Pillars of Well Architected Framework: Security, operational excellence, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimumization. 
### Questions I still have: 
- Are all components that AWS has to offer encompassed by the 5 Pillars? 
- Can reliability also mean availablity ? 
### Quotes: 
- "AWS Trusted Advisor is not focused on just one service and it is not just a security tool."
- "This Framework provides a consistent approach for customers and partners to evaluate architectures, has been used in tens of thousands of workload reviews conducted by the AWS solutions architecture team, and provides guidance to help implement designs that scale with application needs over time."
