# Notes 1: Cloud Concepts Overview


### What is IT? 
- IT can include the mangement and development of software, and administration of a database. Specialists may also provude to a business and its employees. 

### Why is IT Important? 
- Without IT, businesses and schools would be essentially inoperative. 
IT specialists work on: 
- Data overload : Large processing power due to large amounts of data
- Mobile and Wireless usages : Managing remote work options such as smartphones, and laptops with wireless hotsports and the ability to roam. 
- Cloud Services : Many businesses no longer use "server farms" to store data. Now use third-party cloud services such as AWS. 

### Hardware vs. Software
- Hardware is all the physical aspects of an IT system. ie. Motherboard, CPU, RAM, mouse, keyboard.
- Software is not tangible, it encompasses all data, application code and progreams stored digitaly. Software is stored on a hardware device. 

### The Four Pillars of IT 
- __Infrastructure__ : a set of IT components that are the foundation of an IT service. All forms of hardware falland some forms of software. 
- __Development__ : Process of writng and maintaining source code for software applications. Involves all phases of the software development life cycle. Software falls underdevelopment : the process of creating hardware. 
- __Security__ : Prevents unauthorized access to computers, netoworks, data, and software. "It maintains the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information, blocking the access of hackers." Both hardware and software. 
- __Data__ : "Data is represented through quantities, characters, or symbols on which operations are performend by a computer are stored and recorded on magnetic, optical or mechanical recording media, and transmitted in the form of digital electrical signals." Software accesses the data and hardware stores the data. 

### Terminology

- __Motherboard__ : Main circuit board, connects other parts through integrated circuitry. Makes everything work together. Contains CPU, expansion cards, and RAM. 
- __CPU__ : "core processing unit," the CPU runs the operating system and applications, constantly receiving input from the user or active software programs. Processes data and produces output. 
- __RAM__ : "random access memory," every time a program is opened, it gets loaded from the hard drive to the RAM because reading data from RAM is faster than the hard drive. The more RAM, the faster data can be fetched from the CPU, and the faster the computer.  
- __Storage__ : Most common form is an SSD which is non-volatile memory. Have no moving parts which increases access time. 

### New Facts I learned
- The more RAM, the faster the computer, as data can be fetched from the CPU faster. 
- The motherboard contains the CPU. 
- Development is the process of writing and maintaing source code. 

### Questions I still have: 
- Which is the most important language: Java or Python? 
- What does a typical day in the life of an IT specialist look like?
