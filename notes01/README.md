## __What Is IT?__
- IT is the mangement and development of software and hardware for an employer. IT can come in the form of coding, updating, installing, etc. of databases, websites, or security measurements. 
## Why is IT Important? 
- IT is essential for businesses to operate. Maintain data, mobile usages, cloud services. 


### Hardware vs. Software
- Hardware is all the physical aspects of an IT system. ie. Motherboard, CPU, RAM, mouse, keyboard.
- Software is not tangible, it encompasses all data, application code and progreams stored digitaly. Software is stored on a hardware device. 

### The Four Pillars of IT 
- __Infrastructure__ : a set of IT components that are the foundation of an IT service. All forms of hardware falland some forms of software. 
- __Development__ : Process of writng and maintaining source code for software applications. Involves all phases of the software development life cycle. Software falls underdevelopment : the process of creating hardware. 
- __Security__ : Prevents unauthorized access to computers, netoworks, data, and software. "It maintains the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information, blocking the access of hackers." Both hardware and software. 
- __Data__ : "Data is represented through quantities, characters, or symbols on which operations are performend by a computer are stored and recorded on magnetic, optical or mechanical recording media, and transmitted in the form of digital electrical signals." Software accesses the data and hardware stores the data. 

### Terminology

- __Motherboard__ : Main circuit board, connects other parts through integrated circuitry. Makes everything work together. Contains CPU, expansion cards, and RAM. 
- __CPU__ : "core processing unit," the CPU runs the operating system and applications, constantly receiving input from the user or active software programs. Processes data and produces output. 
- __RAM__ : "random access memory," every time a program is opened, it gets loaded from the hard drive to the RAM because reading data from RAM is faster than the hard drive. The more RAM, the faster data can be fetched from the CPU, and the faster the computer.  
- __Storage__ : Most common form is an SSD which is non-volatile memory. Have no moving parts which increases access time. 

### Paying for AWS
- Pay as you go : Only pay for the services you use. This allows you to scale and meet demands; allows you to adapt to business needs without overcommitting budgets. 
- Save when you reserve: For certain services like EC2 and RDS, you can invest in reserved capacity. The larger the upfront payment, the greater the discount. 
- Pay less when you use more: The more you use services such as S3 and data transfer out EC2, the less you pay per GB. 

### Key Principles of Pricing 
- Understanding the fundamentals of pricing : Drivers of cost are storage, compute, and outbound data transfer.

### What is an Operating System? 
- An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language. Without an operating system, a computer is useless. 
### What is an OS' job? 
- Other than managing the computer's hardware and software... The OS coordinates access to the computer's CPU, memory, and storage to ensure the program gets what it needs. 
### Virtual Machines 
- Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. This allows you to build Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) applications for instance-based virtual machines. 
### Platform as a Service
- PaaS allows a company to focus on coding and making apps rather than managing infrastructure. AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides PaaS. It facilitates the quick deployment of applications that you create by providing all the application services that you need.
## Network Address Translation (NAT)
- You can use a NAT device to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet (for example, for software updates) or other AWS services, but prevent the internet from initiating connections with the instances. A NAT device forwards traffic from the instances in the private subnet to the internet or other AWS services, and then sends the response back to the instances. 
### Amazon VPC
- Amazon VPC lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.
- You have complete control over your virtual networking environment. 
- Create an Amazon VPC on AWS's scalable infrastructure and specify its private IP address range from any range you choose.
### Volatile vs Non-Volatile
- Volatile memory is a type of storage whose contents are erased when the system's power is turned off or interrupted. For example, RAM is volatile.
- Non-volatile memory is a term used to describe any memory or storage that is saved regardless of the power to the computer is on or off. ie. ROM
### How Does Cloud Storage Work?
- Cloud storage is purchased from a third party cloud vendor who owns and operates data storage capacity and delivers it over the Internet in a pay-as-you-go model. These cloud storage vendors manage capacity, security and durability to make data accessible to your applications all around the world.
### __What is a Database__
- A database is a shared collection of related data used to support the activities of a particular organization. A database can be viewed as a repository of data that is defined once and then accessed by various users. 
### 5 Pillars of AWS Well ARchitected Framework 
#### Operational Excellence
#### Security
#### Reliability
#### Performance Efficiency
#### Cost Optimization

### WHAT IS CLOUDWATCH
- CloudWatch is a monitoring service embedded in the AWS cloud operating system. Many AWS services use CloudWatch to collect metrics that you can use to analyze how your service is currently operating.
