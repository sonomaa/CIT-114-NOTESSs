# Study Notes from CIT 114 for STUDENT NAME

Taking notes is important when studying for classes or professional certification exams. Writing down information in your own words can not only help you remember but also give you information to review before an exam.

In this assignment, you will be creating your own individual notes using a private software repository on the following topics:

* [Notes 1: Cloud Concepts Overview](notes01/README.md)
* [Notes 2: Cloud Economics, Billing & Support](notes02/README.md)
* [Notes 3: Cloud Global Infrastructure](notes03/README.md)
* [Notes 4: Cloud Secuirty with DevOps](notes04/README.md)
* [Notes 5: Networking & Content Delivery](notes05/README.md)
* [Notes 6: Compute](notes06/README.md)
* [Notes 7: Storage](notes07/README.md)
* [Notes 8: Databases](notes08/README.md)
* [Notes 9: Cloud Architecture](notes09/README.md)
* [Notes 10: Automatic Scaling & Monitoring](notes10/README.md)

## Assignment

You will be requried to turn in 10 draft copies of your notes plus a final draft. Each draft will be on a specific topic and has a prompt you must complete for credit. A final draft of your notes will be turned in at the end of the semester which will expand on your notes beyond the provided prompt. These notes can be on anything you want within the listed topics.

It is important that you **use your own words** as much as possible rather than bulk copy and paste as you will not remember that information as well or at all. Make sure to include any URL's to important resources, upload images, and describe concepts you feel are important.

Within each section, you may add as many files as you wish. You are not restricted to only using the README.md file, which is there as a starting file.

See [Rio Hondo College Canvas](https://riohondo.instructure.com) for each prompt on the drafts and where to turn in the assignment.
